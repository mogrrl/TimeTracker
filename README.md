# timetracker
_A quick and dirty command-line time tracking applet masquerading as a learning ruby exercise_

One of my earliest ruby projects.  I've been hacking on additions to tweak it for my own use rather than refactoring it.
Someday I'll have the time to do a proper refactor.

You may want to add these lines to wherever your bash aliases live
```
alias timetrack='[path_to]/TimeTracker/timetrack.rb'
alias tweaktracker='vi + [path_to]/TimeTracker/tracker.txt'
```
